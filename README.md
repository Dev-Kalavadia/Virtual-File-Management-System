# Virtual-File-Management-System
Developed a virtual filesystem (VFS) using linux commands. A user can create/delete/move folders and files, among other operations described below. The filesystem is be organized as a Tree. Each inode1 contains metadata about the node (e.g., file or folder, size, date).
 
A folder can have zero or many folders and files, while a file is considered as a leaf node only. 
Deleting a file puts the inodeâ€™s element in a limited size queue (the Bin/Trash) which can be emptied manually or automatically. 
The interface allows a user to navigate and perform the described tasks. 
At the beginning and end of the session, the file system is loaded, and dumped to the disk, respectively.
